# Einführung in Machine Learning – Programming Assignments

This repository contains the nine programming assignments I completed independently for the course Einführung in Machine Learning.
All tasks were implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

The exercises cover foundational machine learning topics, progressing from data processing to classical algorithms and modern techniques.

# Completed Programming Assignments
### 1. All About Data

Explored data loading, preprocessing, normalization, and basic statistics.

### 2. Core Concepts

Implemented fundamental ML workflow components, including train/test splits and evaluation metrics.

### 3. Basic Algorithms I

Developed simple classification and regression models; experimented with hyperparameters.

### 4. Basic Algorithms II

Extended earlier models and compared performance across multiple algorithmic approaches.

### 5. Experiment Design & Evaluation

Applied cross-validation, model comparison, and error analysis.

### 6. Machine Learning Theory

Implemented theoretical concepts in code (e.g., bias–variance behavior or margin-based reasoning).

### 7. Probabilistic Machine Learning

Worked with probabilistic models, likelihood-based methods, and uncertainty estimation.

### 8. Distance-Based Algorithms

Implemented k-NN and related similarity-based models; evaluated distance metrics.

### 9. Deep Learning

Built and trained simple neural networks; experimented with architectures and regularization.
